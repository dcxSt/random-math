# Pseudocode for the little script that helps me look at the coefficients of the expantions for the mandelbrot set

the formula is f(c) = c^2 + x, we will be investigating f^n(0) 

Includes:
A method that retunrs an n dimentional array of Natural coefficients of the p th ordered expantion
A method that takes an arrray of coefficients and returns the next list of coefficients
